# X-Wrt #

X-Wrt is a set of packages and patches for OpenWrt that are oriented towards technically apt end users. It is a place for unencumbered additions and changes to the OpenWrt.

X-Wrt is also known as the package Webif^2, and has some availability in the package repository of newer OpenWrt builds. Its compatibility with these newer OpenWrt distributions is decent, though updates need to be made. It is substantially faster than the newer OpenWrt webif LuCI, which is based on a different subsystem.

Webif^2 is based on haserl, and a derivative of the original webif package for OpenWrt White Russian.
